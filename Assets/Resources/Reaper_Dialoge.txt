This is your second chance, donâ€™t waste it. Everything you do here will affect your life, so choose wisely.
Why not check the portals?
Your mind is foggy and time is not on your side.
Your mind is not clear yet.
You get what you seek.
What weighs you will drown you.
Enough running, set yourself free.
The scales of Justice are not balanced by the unbalance you see but by the hidden truth.
Seems like my assistance is needed. I will lend you my vision.
This challenge is the key to everything.
Now you have found your peace.
